        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a junior at DePaul Univeristy studying User Expierence Design with a minor in Game Design. I am originally from Memphis, TN but currently set up roots in Chicago. I have always had a passion for graphic design and coding and decided to combine my favorite aspects of each into focusing on web design. </p>
        <h3>Extra Traits</h3>
        <p>I am a mental health advocate focusing on empowering neurodivergant students. Being neurodivergant myself, I've learned how to work to my strengths utilizing my unique brain chemistry to my advantage to work in ways only I can, setting myself apart in the process. </p>
