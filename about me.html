        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Junior at DePaul Univeristy studying User Experience Design with a minor in Game Design. I am originally
            from Memphis, TN but currently set up roots in Chicago. I have always had a passion for graphic design and
            coding and decided to combine my favorite aspects of each into focusing on web design.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>I am a mental health advocate focusing on empowering neurodivergent students. Being neurodivergent myself, I've
            learned how to work to my strengths utilizing my unique brain chemistry to my advantage to work in ways only I
            can, setting myself apart in the process.</p>
            <br>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing lots of video games and working out. One of my largest hobbies is tinkering with
            computers or anything technology related.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Some additional fun facts about me: I am a competitive powerlifter, which means I am in the gym a lot and care a
            lot about my body.</p>
