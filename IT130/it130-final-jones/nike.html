        <h3>Organic Leather Nike Basketball Shoes</h3>
        <h4>$110</h4>
        <h5>These Leather Nike Basketball Shoes are ones we've hand-picked ourselves. Though bought from Nike, our team breaks the shoes down to the bone and builds them back up to match our quality standards. Our company values align with Nike in the sense that we both experiment with keeping up with modern fashion but know the appreciation of the classics espeically shoes like these. Taking the shoes apart and putting them back together also serves another purpose for our company in altering them to fit our customers needs, we strive to have every one of our products to be perfectly molded to the customer. </h5>
