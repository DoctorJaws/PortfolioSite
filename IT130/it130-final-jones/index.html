            <h2>Clothing</h2>
            <h5>    Our made in-house clothing is made with attention to detail in mind. 
                We quality test all of our clothing to make sure it is up to our standards, including taking care of all of the worst parts of buying clothes.
                We give measurements of all the parts of our clothes to ensure everything fits properly. 
                We offer custom fitting, alterations, and the measurements we supply are post wash, so you do not have to worry about your clothes shrinking on you after the first wash.

            <h2>Shoes</h2>
            <h5>    Our shoe inventory is a mix of hand-made high quality shoes and keeping an inventory of name brand shoes that we deem match our quality standard.
                We understand that every one of our customers is not the same, especially with their feet and how they wear their shoes. We do our best to offer normal and wide sized shoes in all major sizes.
                If we do not have what size you are looking for in our custom made shoes, we can custom order it for you. 
                We also offer a third-party insole service to ensure that your shoes can be the most stylish and comfortable.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h4>American Style got its start back in 1997 in Los Angeles after being inspired by modern clothing style at that time.

                After finding our niche in creating outerwear and some shoes, while also providing name brand shoes that can accompany our outfits.
