    <h3>Our shoes are mostly built in house by our team of designers and tailors, however, we believe that shoes are not our specialty but still a crucial part of our brand that we support. Any shoes we make in-house are tested thoroughly to ensure that they are up to our quality standard. We do carry shoe brands from other companies, however we still do put the shoes through our quality assurance screening to just add that next lever of insurance to your customers. We strive to make sure our customers have the best experience with their shoes, and one of our key values is the perfect balance of style and comfort without sacrificing the other. </h3>
