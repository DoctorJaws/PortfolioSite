        <h3>Multi Color C3 Sneaker</h3>
        <h4>$99</h4>
        <h5>Our own creation, the Multi Color C3 Sneaker, is the most recent creation of our design team in an attempt to break into the sneaker world. These shoes were the outcome of 2 years of designing and prototyping to achieve the modern look of sneakers while maintaining our company's core values of creating a classic product that is the perfect balance of comfort and durability. These shoes are unique in that we can’t stop the shoes from getting dirty, but we took that into account, and no matter how dirty the shoe gets, you will still be able to see three unique colors hence the C3 in the name. Making the shoes ourselves helps us be able to customize the shoe specifically to the customer's needs. </h5>
